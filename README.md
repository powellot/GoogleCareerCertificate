# Google Data Analytics: Capstone
## About
This repository contains my capstone project for the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://grow.google/certificates/data-analytics/#?modal_active=none). This certification requires the successful completion of seven courses plus the capstone (final project), available through the [Coursera Platform](https://www.coursera.org/).

The main goal of the certification was to apply the concepts introduced throughout the seven courses:

    * Going through the Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, and Share phases of the data analysis process;
    * Stating a business task clearly;
    * Importing data from a real dataset;
    * Documenting any data cleaning that you perform on the dataset;
    * Analyzing the data;
    * Creating data visualizations from your analysis;
    * Summarizing key findings from your analysis;
    * Documenting your conclusions and recommendations;
    * Creating and publishing your case study.

To demonstrate these skills, learners are offered two tracks:

* Track 01: Working with existing questions and datasets.
* Track 02: Choosing your question and dataset.

It is not required to complete a capstone to receive the certification, however, I chose to complete one option from Track 01 to demonstrate professional skills and make myself more employable.

## Track 01 Details
This is the track I chose initially to complete my certification and demonstrate my new skills to employers. Google defined this track as:

> "The first track involves a case study similar to what you might be asked for in a job interview. You will be given a business task, dataset, and list of specific deliverables that you must present to stakeholders. The first track will help you to create a case study that you could include in your portfolio to demonstrate job skills for future interviews. You can choose from between two cases. Once you decide which case study packet to use, you will read the details, complete the analysis, and create your finished case study."
> "If this track interests you, explore the case study options and decide which one you want to perform. The case study packets available for download have everything that you need to complete your case study. Then, you will be ready to upload and share your case study with potential employers."

Taking this into consideration, I chose to complete the BellaBeat Case Study.
