# Bellabeat Case Study

### Scenario
> You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide the marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

We have been tasked with answering three questions:

```
  1. What are some trends in smart-device usage?
  2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
  3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy?
```

In order to effectively and concisely answer these questions with relevant and accurate data, I will be using the 6 step data analysis process: ask, prepare, analyze, share, and act.

## Stage 1: Ask
### Background

> Bellabeat is a wellness company founded by Urška Sršen and Sandro Mur in 2014. It is best known for its Leaf smart jewelry wearable line. The company has offices in San Francisco, Zagreb and Hong Kong. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellabeat)

The overall goal of this project is to analyze smart device usage to gain insight into how non-Bellabeat smart devices are being used to guide the Bellabeat marketing strategy.

In addition to answering the three questions listed in the [scenario]() section of this write-up, I need to be able to deliver the following:

```
  1. A summary of the business task.
  2. A description of the data sources used.
  3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data.
  4. A summary of the analysis.
  5. High-level content recommendations based on the analysis.
```
